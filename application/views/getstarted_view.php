<h2><span id="internal-source-marker_0.0763063789345324">The nine basic steps in getting started today . . . </span></h2>
  <ol>
    <li><span> Please <a href="/site/contactus">provide us with your Contact information</a>:</span>
      <ol>
        <li><span>          Name</span></li>
        <li><span>          Address: (of the site you are interested in installing a PV System)</span></li>
        <li><span>          Phone:</span></li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li><span> Call your local utility company (APS, SRP) and ask for a copy of your annual account summary from the prior year. </span></li>
    <li><span> We compile and evaluate your electrical consumption needs based on this information. </span></li>

    <li><span> Our engineers will develop a &quot;best case&quot; preliminary design for your solar installation. </span></li>
    <li><span> We research the applicable financial incentives and energy rebates available to your home or business including incentives contained in the recently passed federal stimulus package. </span></li>
    <li><span> After completing items #1 through # 6, we present our findings and a preliminary cost analysis to assure the installation can meet your initial financial and savings expectations. </span></li>
    <li><span> We then make a site visit to your facility or business to confirm our initial findings whereby we validate site dimensions, elements that may alter efficiencies, and take site photos. </span></li>
    <li><span> We refine our preliminary engineering and conduct a detailed energy consumption and financial analysis to determine the most cost effective system, the best use of materials, and best financing options if necessary to meet your needs. </span></li>
    <li><span> Upon completion of these tasks, we will deliver to you a detailed solar installation proposal outlining everything that you and your management team and or family will need to know in making a solid business decision. </span></li>
